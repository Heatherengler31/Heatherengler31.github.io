            <p>No. You're too short and bossy, and your nose is all funny. Please tell me I didn't get old. Anything but old. I was young! Oh... is he grey? Look at me. No plans, no backup, no weapons worth a damn. Oh, and something else I don't have: anything
                to lose. So, if you're sitting up there with your silly little spaceships and your silly little guns and you've any plans on taking the Pandorica tonight; just remember who's standing in your way. Remember every black day I ever stopped
                you and then, and then, do the smart thing. Let somebody else try first.Do you want a jelly baby? Don't be sad Grace. You'll do great things. Jamie, remind me to give you a lesson in tying knots, sometime. This thing is smaller on the inside than it is on the outside. Life depends on change and renewal. My ship…my TARDIS… Oh my word! Dreams are important…never underestimate them. I am the Doctor! The original, you might say! Oh I'm so sorry, Jamie. Would you like a jelly baby? Goodbye.</p>

            <h2>Welcome to Power For art</h2>
            <p>I once spent a hell of a long time trying to get a gobby Australian to Heathrow airport. Please tell me I didn't get old. Anything but old. I was young! Oh... is he grey? There are fixed points throughout time where things must stay exactly
                the way they are. This is not one of them. This is an opportunity! Whatever happens here will create its own timeline, its own reality, a temporal tipping point. The future revolves around you, here, now, so do good! No idea. Just do what
                I do: hold tight and pretend it's a plan. You are the only mystery worth solving. I need...I need...I need... fish fingers and custard! There's something that doesn't make sense. Let's go and poke it with a stick. Overconfidence, this,
                and a small screwdriver. I’m absolutely sorted. Come along, Pond! Goodbye, Clara. No. You're too short and bossy, and your nose is all funny. No idea. Just do what I do: hold tight and pretend it's a plan. I know. Dinosaurs! On a spaceship</p>
